# Song of Camelot

## Submission for Dojo Game Jam 6

### Project Summary

Song of Camelot is an on-chain game where players compete to dominate a map by strategically placing elemental influences. This project includes a main game application and a separate login wrapper that uses the Cartridge wallet system for a seamless user onboarding experience.

### How to Play

To run this project, you will need to run two separate applications simultaneously: the login wrapper and the main game.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js and npm
*   Dojo toolchain (`sozo`, `katana`)

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gogibear/song-of-camelot.git
cd song-of-camelot
```

**2. Set up the Login Wrapper**

First, we'll get the login application running. This handles wallet connection and player creation.

```bash
# Navigate to the login wrapper's contract directory
cd login-wrapper/contract

# Build and migrate the contracts
sozo build
sozo migrate

# Navigate to the login wrapper's client directory
cd ../client

# Install dependencies and start the dev server
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the login wrapper on `http://localhost:3002`. Keep this terminal open.

**3. Set up the Main Game**

Now, in a **new terminal window**, we'll start the main game application.

```bash
# Navigate to the main game's contract directory from the project root
cd contract

# Build and migrate the contracts
sozo build
sozo migrate

# Navigate to the main game's client directory
cd ../client/project

# Install dependencies and start the dev server
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the main game on `http://localhost:5173`. Keep this terminal open as well.

**4. Play the Game!**

*   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3002`.
*   You will see the "Enter Avalon" login screen. Click "Begin Quest" to connect your wallet.
*   Once you are logged in, you will be automatically redirected to the main game at `http://localhost:5173`.
